        <cell colspan="3">Entrepreneurship has become a steering engine for economic development and a bridged be- tween unemployment, underdevelopment, and poverty. Entrepreneurship has received a lot of attention among the developed economy. Various literature have intensively discussed on the entrepreneurial intention among tertiary intuitions but with less attention on the entrepreneur- ial intention among secondary school students as the basis for learning that link between sec- ondary school and tertiary institutions. This paper reviewed the entrepreneurial intention among secondary school students and the moderating role of access to financing. Access to financing is considered the fundamental sources needed by any entrepreneur/s to assist them in the running and operations of their businesses. This study proposed a conceptual frame- work with the relationship between entrepreneurship and entrepreneurial intention. Prior lit- erature is developed based on the Theory of Planned Behaviour (TPB) as the most used mod- el to determine entrepreneurial intention. This study also seeks to identify the moderating role of access to financing in the relationship between entrepreneurship and entrepreneurial inten- tion. The conceptual framework was developed to harmonize the understanding of four main variables supported by the prior literature. This study is very important to highlight the stake- holders such as government, community, private organizations, non-governmental organiza- tions (NGOs) and entrepreneurs on the factors that are essential to influence entrepreneurial intention among students and accessibility of funds is very crucial factor that moderate stu- dents' entrepreneurial intentions especially for those who are in their secondary education years.</cell>

        <cell colspan="3">Entrepreneurship promotion and entrepreneurial activities are the mainstream for eco- nomic growth and development. The unsatisfactory wealth distribution, imbalanced of educa- tional opportunities, inadequate water, and electricity, poor infrastructural development, in- sufficient security and unemployment, and underdevelopment are the main motivator for innovation, creativity and new venture creation for viable economy progress (Hoogendoorn, Zwan, &amp; Thurik, 2016). It???s a known fact that entrepreneurship is the fundamental factor and a driving engine for National growth, because National building depends primarily on the ac-</cell>

The economic growth and development of African countries largely depend on the activities of the entrepreneurs but the objectives of the entrepreneurship program and promotion of entrepreneurial activities among the people cannot be achieved without government support on the entrepreneurship (Osalor, 2016). Developed nations are worried about the persistent increment of unemployment rate among the citizens hence, the nascent economies major concern is job creation and find a solution this issue seen potential to be overcome through promoting and encouraging entrepreneurial activities (Crecente- Romero, Gimenez-Baldazo, &amp; Rivera-Galicia, 2018). Entrepreneurship global reports have indicated that entrepreneurial activities in developing economy did not give more emphasis on venture creation but rather job seekers than job givers (Hoogendoorn et al., 2016 and GERA, 2018). Many global pieces of research have indicated that entrepreneurship is the buffer for economic growth. This emphasis was not given serious highlight in secondary school students particularly in Nigeria, but rather in the higher learning environment.</cell>

        <cell colspan="2">Many studies have been conducted in various disciplines such as in business schools us- ing business students in certain population (Maresch, Harms, Kailer, &amp; Wimmer-Wurm, 2016). It is also conducted in different academic setting (Gonzalez-Serrano, &amp; Gonz??lez- Garc??a, 2018) with different samples size (Koe, 2016). Prior entrepreneurial intention re- searches have shown that it???s one of the areas which received a swiftly progressing (Linan &amp; Fayolle, 2015). Hence, there is a need for more entrepreneurial intention studies to be carried out, especially in secondary schools. This study aims to provide a proposed conceptual framework for the relationship between entrepreneurship and entrepreneurial intention. This study introduced access to financing as a moderator in order to straightening the relationship between entrepreneurship and entrepreneurial intention. Various studies have discussed using different variables in a different setting, this study focused on the secondary schools' students.</cell>

        <cell>Problem statement</cell>
      </row>
      <row>
        <cell colspan="2">Due to high increase in the world population and fast growth and development in the area of technology, entrepreneurship was regarded as a means of healthy economy for every na- tion. There are quite a number of considerable entrepreneurship programs and agencies that are involved in the entrepreneurship programs in Nigeria. Despite the fact that entrepreneur- ship activities is very low in Nigeria, the level of unemployment is at sorry stage which en- capsulated the rural migration to urban cities in search of work and these worsen the situa- tion. This problem is attributed to high rate of school drop-out from primary and secondary due to financial problems, corruption and mismanagement by the government officials (Ajagbe, Kelechi, Kimuli, &amp; Cho, 2016; Ojiaku, Nkamnebe, &amp; Nwaizugbo, 2018). This prob- lem is able to be reduced through introduction of entrepreneurship education in secondary schools but empirical findings have proven that, the introduction of entrepreneurship educa- tion is mainly on tertiary institutions without fully considering secondary schools (Nwite, 2016; Okon &amp; Friday, 2015). Nevertheless, Onuma (2016) confirmed that most of the Nigeri- an graduates are still lingering the street looking for a white collar job instead of becoming self-employed but this is due to, they lack entrepreneurial skills or basic know-how to be self- employ. Regardless the effort putting by different administration in Nigeria to introduce vari- ous entrepreneurial programs but yet the majority of the graduates are still unemployed (Onuma, 2016). This problem needs to be addressed in order to curtail unforeseen circum- stances that may trigger social vices and criminal activities in the society due to poverty and unemployment.</cell>

        <cell colspan="3">This study would examine the relationship between entrepreneurship and entrepreneurial intention adopting Ajzen Theory of Planned Behaviour (TPB) model. From the philosophical point of view, the intention and attitudes of a person are innate belief which motivates him to perform a certain behavior. Thus, entrepreneurship perspectives, an entrepreneur believed and his psychological credence and innate behavior is what trigger him to have the intention to start or create a new business (Zewudu &amp; Alamnie, 2018).</cell>

        <cell colspan="3">Various economies have professed that entrepreneurship is the bridge that links to the pro- gressive local economy. Entrepreneurship influence creativity, innovation, new business idea, creates technology and for operational business, which would upsurge economic growth and development and create number of employment among the people (Acs, Szerb, &amp; Lloyd, 2017). Consequently, many countries have seen entrepreneurship as the approach which cre- ates a healthy economy for viable and for the competitive benefits at the time of internation- alization period (Shamsudin, Mamun, Nawi, Nasir, &amp; Zakaria, 2017). Various literatures have considered that entrepreneurship played a significant role in finding a solution to the menace of poverty and unemployment among youth in an energetic society (Pauceanu, 2016). Possibly, it is because entrepreneurship is a multidisciplinary area which contains the herit- age, psychology, environmental culture and sociology (Pauceanu, Alpenidze, Edu, &amp; Zaharia, 2018). The concept of entrepreneurship has been worldly recognized, entrepreneurship has been defined by various authors among the most accepted definition of entrepreneurship is by Schumpeter (1934) cited by (Che, Mistima, &amp; Mohd, 2015) entrepreneurship is the process of adding value to an existing business which transform and change the business idea into a new look. According to Musa, Ainuddin, Lee, Abdullah and Wahid (2016) entrepreneurship is the ability of a person to start a new business from the existing one with the available resources and bear all the unforeseen risks. Kibler (2013) believed that entrepreneurship is the relation- ship that connects a person and his societal beliefs.</cell>

        <cell>Entrepreneurship intention (EI)</cell>

      <row>
        <cell colspan="3">Entrepreneurship intention is the fundamental elements which determine people???s rationale to inspire new business formation (Krueger, Reilly, &amp; Carsrud, 2000). Inspiration influences people???s desire to become attracted to certain activities through his beliefs such as locus of control and role model (Ajzen, 1991). However, the intention is the predictor to measure the extent to which person desire to involve in the new venture creation (Mba, 2018). Ajzen (1991) sees intention as ???the indication of how hard people are willing to try of how much an effort they are planning to exert in order to perform the behaviour??? (p. 181). Entrepreneurial intention is the person???s interest and inclination to involve into entrepreneurial activities to- wards creating a new venture (Salami, 2019). It is also the personal choice to start a new business in the nearest time to come (Sesen, 2012). EI is the psychological state of a personal emotion cognitive processes at a definite period of time to venture into business (Karimi, Biemans, Lans, Chizari, &amp; Mulder, 2016) the robust the intention, the higher its accomplish a behavior. In the study of Y??ld??r??m, ??ak??r and A??kun (2016) they stated that entrepreneurial intention it is an inspiration of a person to create new venture. Krueger (2007) he believed that entrepreneurial intention hypothetically behind a personal believed for a person to create new venture is due to good or bad experience, but it is the deliberate intended behavioural functions.</cell>
